*brief description*
In this this project, we've used the NEO6M GPS module and interfaced it with the Tiva C launchpad
to create a simple embedded system capable of extracting the longitude and latitude of user,
and making simple decisions based on these data.

We have deployed the UART synchronization protocol in making the launchpad communicate with the GPS module, and have wrote functions to calculate distance and toggle LEDs both built in the board and external (on a breadboard, via GPIO).
